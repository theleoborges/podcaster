Jane: Welcome to this week's episode of "Work From Home Uncovered", where we dive into the latest research and trends in remote work. I'm Jane Sun, CEO of Trip.com Group, and I'm joined by my co-host Matt.

Matt: Thanks for having me, Jane. Today we're exploring the concept of hybrid work, and why it's gaining traction in the business world. We'll be discussing the results of a recent study conducted by my colleagues Nicholas Bloom, James Liang, and Ruobing Han.

Jane: That's right. The study involved a real company, one of the largest online travel companies, with 40,000 employees. The researchers randomly assigned employees to a three-day or five-day in-office schedule and analyzed the results.

Matt: So, what did we find out? Well, the study showed that employees who worked from home three days a week experienced higher productivity and performance review grades than those working in the office five days a week. But that's not all.

Jane: The researchers also found that the company's middle managers reversed their previously skeptical views on working from home after seeing the positive results.

Matt: That's right. And it wasn't just about productivity and performance reviews. The study also showed that employees working from home had a higher satisfaction rate, and quit rates were significantly lower. Quit-rate reductions were largest for female employees and those with long commutes greater than 1.5 hours.

Jane: So, what are the key takeaways from this study? In our opinion, it's all about creating a culture of experimentation and continuous improvement. Having leadership buy-in is critical to supporting a successful strategy.

Matt: We also learned that Trip.com has been highly data-driven in its decision-making, using A/B experimentation to continuously improve productivity. The company has been conducting these experiments for over a decade, refining their management practices and achieving positive results.

Jane: One of the most interesting findings from this study is that hybrid employees put in longer hours on their office days and weekends to make up for the time they're working from home. But that's okay, because these workers found that their home-days were useful for important activities like doctor's appointments or leisure activities.

Matt: That's the key to successful hybrid work, Jane. By providing employees with a clear and coordinated schedule, and by being supportive of their needs, companies can create an environment where everyone can thrive.

Jane: And that brings us to our final point. The value of A/B testing in management practices is far rarer than it should be. By doing these experiments, companies can refine their strategies and achieve positive results.

Matt: Thanks for joining us on this episode of "Work From Home Uncovered", Jane. We hope you found it informative and helpful.

Jane: Absolutely, Matt. And to our listeners out there, we encourage you to think about how hybrid work can benefit your organization and employees. By adopting a more flexible approach, you can unlock employee potential and achieve greater success.

Matt: That's all for today. Thanks for tuning in, and we'll see you next time on "Work From Home Uncovered".
